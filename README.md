## TUES WD18/19 Examinations Backend
### Test checker

A repository that contains the script that checks  examination works in class.

It aims to prove whether all the submitted pages are in the correct format and to look for some basic elements that were pointed out as requirements.
At the end of the task, it'd have to generate a personalized report in .pdf format.

It's important that all the submitted files are **zipped** (_.zip, not .rar_) and are in the format CLASS\_NUMER.zip (_for example A\_25.zip for number 25 from class A_). Exceptions from the above shown format would not be accepted.

Bear in mind that every project should have the three mandatory pages with specific names. Significant deprivations would be assigned in case some of the pages is missing or more pages are present.
